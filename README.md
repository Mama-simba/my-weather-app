### What I learned

I attended an online Frontend Development bootcamp at [SheCodes](https://www.shecodes.io/students/276-cristina-padilla), where I had to deliver weekly coding challenges and a Weather App as a final project.
In order to built this project, I previously learnt:

* HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to make the app's design responsive.
* JavaScript techniques (ES6) to create an interactive application.
* API integration to access realtime weather information.
* GitHub to host my code's project online and make it visible to others.
* Netlify to host my project and get a real domain/Url to share it proudly with others.
